RunPlaylist
----

Project to help familiarize myself with SwiftUI

Easily add the currently playing song to the running playlist of your choice. Sometimes I run on the treadmill searching for the right song, but adding it is too disruptive to my workout.

### Learning concepts WIP

- Combine with SwiftUI
- Data flow
- View composition
- Navigation

Should build a watch version too.
